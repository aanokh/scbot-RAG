# __SC Bot__
A simple Starcraft 2 bot made with the burny python-sc2 API. The bot's functions include simple scouting, economy management and army control. Future planned features include creep spread, reactive army compositions, advanced scouting networks and multi-prong army control.
The bot plays a mostly defensive reactionary playstyle which matches the strengths of the Zerg race, letting it remain as effective as possible against both real players and other bot opponents.

To aid with the development process, an LLM Assistant is used with the OpenAI API. The python-sc2 codebase has been uploaded into OpenAI's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool allowing the LLM chatbot to provide feedback and advice on developing this project.
